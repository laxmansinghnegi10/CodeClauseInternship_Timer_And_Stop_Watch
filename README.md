# CodeClauseInternship_Timer_And_Stop_Watch
During my Code Clause Internship Program I have created a GUI Timer and Stop Watch project where user can start the time whenever user want as well as also stop the time whenever the user want .Along with this user can also reset the time whenever he want .There are 2 buttons displayed on the display when we run the code ,i.e., Stop and reset.
